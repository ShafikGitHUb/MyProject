1 Answer : var used before ES6 . after update js ES6 then come let and const. we use const once time and let several time.
like -  let name : "Shafik"
             name: " Prince" [ update name this time not use to let variable just used variable name]
        
2 Answer : spread used array or object property watched each and each. example - 
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(...numbers);  result output: 1, 2, 3  , we used spread operator when one array copy to anthore array


3  Answer: we used map() for update the array value; like - const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
                                                           const result = numbers.map(num => num * 2);
                                                           console.log(result);
                                                           Output will be : 2,4,3,6

And we used filter() method to filter anything. after filtering we find the filtering value;
forEach() used for looping when we need array looping we used for of loop or forEach loop 


4 Answer : Arrow function introduced ES6. using the arrown syntax => : example-
             const add =()=>{
                console.log("Hello");
             }
             add();

5 Answer : It's come to new after introduced ES6. written as a `` and ${} syntan use into notation ``;
          const name = "Shafik";
          const Para = `Hello, ${name}.`;
          console.log(para); 
          output :  Hello, Shafik.
